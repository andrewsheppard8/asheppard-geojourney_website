# asheppard-geojourney_Website

I am going on a big trip through Asia and I want to practice creating an API using Flask. That was the start, anyway. Now it is much more than that.

It now includes muliple databases, authentication, image clean up/optimization, usese Leaflet, Cesium and Map Libre. It is fully updatable within the browser. 

I am in the process of creating a site update page to track continuing updates to the site. Bu

Some minor things I always forget:

geojson==3.2.0

git pull origin main --rebase

pip freeze > requirements.txt
